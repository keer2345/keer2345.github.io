Arrested -- A new framework for building REST APIs using Python. We’ll use Docker, SQLAlchemy, and other tools to build a Star Wars themed API in 5 minutes!

Here are some resources for some of the tools we’ll be using

- [Docker](http://docker.com/) — Docker is used throughout our examples.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) — We’ll be using git to clone some repositories
- [Cookie Cutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  — Cookie Cutter is a project templating tool
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) — Arrested builds on top of Flask, a micro framework for Python based on Werkzeug
- [Kim](http://kim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) — A Python Marshaling and Serialization framework.
- [Arrested](https://github.com/mikeywaites/flask-arrested) — A Framework For Rapidly Building REST APIs with Flask.
